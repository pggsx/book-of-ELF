/* Enumerated types are helpful in many, many scenarios when the exact number
 * of elements are known. This is similar to creating constants like:
 *
 * #define BLUESTONE 0
 * #define MEMORIAL 1
 * ...
 *
 * The major difference is that these are now real types that the compiler can
 * check. Thus, in code, we can write:
 *
 *   area_t area = BLUESTONE;
 *   printf ("%s Area\n", AREAS[area]);
 *
 * The output would be "Bluestone Area" based on the constants in map-const.c.
 *
 * The following would produce a compiler error with enumerated types, but would
 * not if we just used #define constants:
 *
 *   bldg_t building = MEMORIAL;
