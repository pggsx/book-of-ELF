==============================================================================

Week of 8/31 - 9/6 (sample entry)

Project status summary:

    * Total test cases passed: 6
    * New test cases passed this week: alarm-priority, alarm-simultaneous
    * Next test case(s) to attempt: priority-change, priority-sema

We made good progress on the alarm clock scheduler this week, and got it
switched over to priority-based. We are now going to start working on adding
support for changing priorities.

Contribution summary:

    * Larry and Moe met to work on the alarm-priority test case and got that
      working correctly.
    * Curly updated the design document, answering question A4.
    * Curly and Moe completed the alarm-simultaneous test case, based on
      suggestions from Larry.

Questions and issues:

The priority-sema test case looks fairly straightforward, but the expected
output seems unusual. It looks like the priority levels should all be lower
than the main thread, but they seem to preempt the main thread. Why should the
child threads preempt the main thread?

Week of 9/10 - 9/17

Project status summmary: 

		* Total Test Cases Passed :
		* 
		*


Contribution summary:
		* (9/13) Pavan,Patrick and Connor got file parsing/string parsing implemented Due to
		* permission errors,Pavan has been pushing commits to repository
		* (9/14) Pavan, Patrick, and Connor began working on multi-threading the mandelbrot-set
		* (9/15) Pavan, Patrick continued worked on multi-threading mandelbrot, while Connor 
		* began working on msort.
		* (9/16) Pavan, Patrick and Connor finished getting multi-threading for mandelbrot and
		* achieving writing to a TGA file (not properly formatted)
		* (9/17) Pavan and Patrick worked on potential ideas for formatting the TGA file to work
		* with both the mandelbrot set and the header information 
		* (9/20) Patrick got the header working and the TGA file generated properly. Pavan, Patrick
		* and Connor worked on getting the msort multi-threading working. 
		* (9/21) Pavan and Patrick got the msort multi-threading working (mostly). Due to time
		* constraints, we were unable to fully test and debug the multi-threaded msort
		* implementation. It sorts accordingly, however due to logic error, it does not merge
		* properly at the end of the recursive calls within each thread. 
Questions and issues:
	Mickey Rosen has made an effort to attend group meetings, however due to distrations and
other "personal reasons", he was unable to make major contributions to this project. The group
has expressed their concerns, they hope that Mickey will aide the group in future projects.

Due to legacy documentation, we were unable to conduct "analysis" of our application due to 
the absence of the ANALYSIS file within our source code repository that was originally given to
us.
